- Passing data via _props_
- Splitting components into multiple components
- Organizing component files
- Listening to events & working with event handlers
- Working with _State_ , _useState_ hook
- Handling form submission
- Adding two-way binding
- Lifting the state up ( Child-to-Parent component communication)
- Rendering lists of data
- Outputting conditional content
- Adding conditional return statements
